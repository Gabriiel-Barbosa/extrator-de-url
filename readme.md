## **About**

This is a Python URL extractor that uses regular expressions (regex) to validate whether the provided URL is valid and to extract relevant information from it, such as the URL base and the parameters present in it.

## How it works
When creating a URLExtractor object by passing a URL as a parameter, the URL is validated to ensure that it is valid and contains the necessary components to be processed. If the URL is invalid, a ValueError exception is raised.

Once the URL is validated, it is possible to extract the URL base and the parameters present in it using the get_url_base and get_url_parametros methods, respectively. It is also possible to extract the value of a specific parameter using the get_valor_parametro method.

## Implemented functionalities
The following functionalities have been implemented in the URL extractor:

Validation of the URL to ensure that it is valid and contains the necessary components to be processed
Extraction of the URL base
Extraction of the parameters present in the URL
Extraction of the value of a specific parameter.
